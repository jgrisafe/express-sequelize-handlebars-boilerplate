## Express Sequelize Handlebars Boilerplate

### Setup

1. clone repo
2. npm install
3. create db named blogger in mySQL workbench or SequelPro
4. node server.js

This project renders views in two different ways so you can choose how you want to code!

- The blog template uses handle bars to display data on the page server-side
- The authors and cms templates use jQuery ajax to retrieve data on the client, and then builds the view with jQuery dom manipulation
